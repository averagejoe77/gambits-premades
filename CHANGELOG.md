  - Fire Form: Updated Fire Elemental's monster feature to use Aura Effects instead of Active Auras
  - Cold Aura: Updated Ice Spider Queen's monster feature to use Aura Effects instead of Active Auras
  - Flash of Genius: Updated to account for sheet rolls

## [v2.1.14] - 2025-09-22
- Updates:
  - Opportunity Attack: Tried to scrape some more performance out of Opportunity Attacks. Increased duration of timeout period before a region will update itself on movement and coalesced to a single update with improved logic. Added new onTurnStart behavior that will turn off onExit and onEnter processing for that tokens region on their turn. This prevents any of the OA logic from firing on a tokens turn when they don't need it anyway, and should help a smidge with performance on lower end machines. onTurnEnd will re-enable the onExit and onEnter events for normal processing of OA.
- Bugfixes:
  - Shield Master: Fixed a couple bugs introduced in the last update
  - Silvery Barbs: Fixed an issue that could occur in certain circumstances for the save ability pickup. Added text to the SB output description defining what item the SB use was for.

  - Opportunity Attack: Fixed incorrect debug log text for sight
  - Silvery Barbs: Added handling for ability checks triggered via a midi activity
  - Riposte: Added origin item lookup for the Combat Superiority item to better align with CPR (I think)
- Bugfixes:
  - Shield Master: Resolved Shield Bash never prompting after the first use, and Shield Bash potentially popping up on Opportunity Attacks
  - Elemental Affinity: Resolved damage type not being parsed correctly in some circumstances

## [v2.1.12] - 2025-09-08
- Updates:
  - freeSpellUse: Revamped freeSpellUse function. As a reminder, this can be used by adding gpsFreeSpellUse to an activity Chat Flavor text box. Previously this only supported a single free use per long rest. Now also supports configuring the number of uses when setting the activity up to use Item or Activity Uses. This will account for the number of uses, as well as the recharge duration option set (Long Rest, Short Rest, or Daily). You can still simply add gpsFreeSpellUse without item/activity uses to have a simple once per long rest effect added.

## [1.0.14] - 2025-03-22

- Additions: Arcane Archer: Updated to add all Arcane Archer shot types. These are now housed as activities on the Arcane Shot item, you will still need the individual Arrow types (Bursting, Shadow, etc) from my compendium/medkit so that appropriate arrow activities are displayed.
- Updates:
  - Multiple Items: Updated synthetic activity handling to socket the use to the appropriate user where relevant. NOTE: Module now requires Midi 12.4.34 minimum as there were some important bugfixes for socketing activities
  - Silvery Barbs: Added activity handling for Save events. Should make them more resilient in the future.
  - Indomitable: Added activity handling for Save reroll. Should make this more resilient in the future.
  - Region Wrapping: Update Region Wrapping to use default behavior on square gridded scenes to resolve some intermittent issues with region teleporting.
  - Opportunity Attack: Added updated region shapes for OA. Gridless now uses a squircle shape, and Hex grids use a hex shape. Added new DAE flags oaImmunity and oaSuppression. oaImmunity can be added to an effect on a token to prevent any opportunity attacks against it. oaSuppression can be added to an effect on a token to prevent it from being able to make any opportunity attacks. NOTE: The old method of looking for a named effect ex. Opportunity Attack Immunity for general immunity or a specific item effect ex. Shocking Grasp will be deprecated in the future, premades or individual automations should use these dae flags moving forward.
  - Counterspell: Added Subtle Spell casting support. Counterspell will now present a checkbox to the user to use Subtle Spell when present and sorcery points available. If checked, the spell will become un-counterspellable and the appropriate sorcery point will be used.
  - GPS Dialogs: Added support for Carolingian UI. GPS Dialogs colors will now match color theming from Carolingian if present.
- Bugfixes:
  - Temporal Shunt: Fixed a couple issues and re-worked to use an activity on the roll.

- Bugfixes
  - Opportunity Attack: Updated the Brace integration in OA to target the creature the attack is against and removed some unneeded code. Should now properly integrate with CPRs Brace feature.
  - Lighting Throw Action: Updated to remove the need for users to give explicit permissions to the Default Item Piles actor for the Throw action. The Torch/Candle/Lantern/etc automations will now assign the appropriate permissions for the user when the throw occurs.
  - Vicious Mockery: Fix bug preventing effect from being applied and incorrect macroPass provided on item.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-02-27

- Bugfixes

- Bugfixes
  - Opportunity Attack: Fix some unresolved bugs with the new war caster stuff due to les incompetents

## [1.0.4] - 2025-02-25

- Additions
  - Grim Siphon: Reminder to checkout Kobold Press Deep Magic 2. V4.x compatability
- Updates
  - Dimension Door: Added a fun animation to crosshair move while selecting teleport location. Playing around with it has inspired a future update to Template Previewer I think
- Bugfixes
  - Opportunity Attack: Resolve an additional issue with War Caster medkit options causing issues due to a config flag not being output unless the customConfig value had been changed. Resolve issues with midi-qol outputting a range error message in certain instances. This cannot be a complete fix as other automations sometimes modify weapons/spells after use, but should fix most instances especially for weapons. My suggestion is to just turn off MidiQOLs out of range checking if you want to avoid any issues entirely.
  - Cloud of Daggers: Resolve appropriate damage type not being assigned in DamageOnlyWorkflow

## [1.0.3] - 2025-02-24

- Bugfixes
  - Opportunity Attack: Fix issue with attacks displaying out of range. Fix issue with some accidental code left in during the war caster re-work.

  - Roksjas Husk: Reminder to visit Abyssal Brews Patreon. V4.x compatability

  - Weavers Hoop: Reminder to visit Abyssal Brews Patreon. V4.x compatability

## [1.0.2] - 2025-02-23

- Bugfixes
  - Opportunity Attack: Fixed a few issues with the War Caster integration not recognizing spells correctly. Added a CPR config option to War Caster to allow disabling melee or ranged spell attacks. Disabling ranged will disable rsak and save actionTypes. Disabling melee will disable msak actionTypes.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-02-22

- Official 5e V4.x+ Release!
  - This has been a large re-work of items from GPS to better support Foundrys new activities system. Most automations that synthetically created items/features/etc now use an on item activity which can be more easily modified by users to adjust things such as the saving throw, dc, damage type, etc. All item code has now been built into the module and is no longer located on each item in the compendium to allow easier updates in the future. Any kofi support is appreciated.
  - NOTE: All automations are still built for 2014. Ive opted to wait on 2024 as CPR has opted to build most of those automations on their end, and I do not want to duplicate work on my end. There will likely be some exceptions for more complex automations such as Counterspell where I also have a lot of unique handling for various interactions and homebrew requests.
  - NOTE: This release covers all 5e automations, and a handful of 3rd party content automations. I will continue to build out 3rd party content automations, but homebrow items have not been updated. Just because it has not been updated specifically for 4.x does not mean it doesnt work, but homebrew items see minimal use, so I will accept requests to update specific homebrew automations in my Posneys Foundry Automation discord thread if you have one you are using on 4.x+ that does not work.
  - NOTE: There will likely be some bugs in this release as its a large re-work, you can report any bugs you find on my github or posneys foundry automation discord thread
- Item Callouts:
  - Counterspell: Now uses activities for ability checks. Multitude of small tweaks for better functionality surrounding that, should be better than ever.
  - Torch/Lamp/Candle/Lanterns: Large rework of these automations. All now have a throwable option if Item Piles is enabled. All now will not consume a quantity use unless the item is thrown. Quantity now comes down to a gm determination of when the item is empty/burned out, in which case a quantity use can be done on the item itself. Extinguishing and relighting an item will simply reset its effect timer. Since all items can be thrown, Im leaving it in the hands of gms to determine whether something is thrown successfully. Ex. Setting a candle down next to you, probably fine. Hurling a candle 60 feet, its likely not staying lit (or is it? #nat20s).
